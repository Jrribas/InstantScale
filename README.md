# InstantScale
Reads SEM images scale, crops the white bar, and creates a new smaller scale on a corner of your choice.

Note: This program was created to work on the SEM images from our university, so it may or not work for your images! But try it, and if doesn´t work, create a post in issues with a image example and maybe we can help ;)
